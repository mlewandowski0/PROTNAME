The family member LEM3 (Swiss:P42838) is a ligand-effect modulator, mutation of which increases glucocorticoid receptor activity in response to dexamethasone and also confers increased activity on other intracellular receptors including the progesterone, oestrogen and mineralocorticoid receptors. LEM3 is thought to affect a downstream step in the glucocorticoid receptor pathway. Factors that modulate ligand responsiveness are likely to contribute to the context-specific actions of the glucocorticoid receptor in mammalian cells [PMID:11063677]. The products of genes YNR048w (Swiss:P53740), YNL323w (Swiss:P42838) and YCR094w (Swiss:P25656) (CDC50) show redundancy of function and are involved in regulation of transcription via CDC39 [PMID:11180453]. CDC39 (also known as NOT1) is normally a negative regulator of transcription either by affecting the general RNA polymerase II machinery or by altering chromatin structure [PMID:8428577]. One function of CDC39 is to block activation of the mating response pathway in the absence of pheromone, and mutation causes arrest in G1 by activation of the pathway [PMID:2099190]. It may be that the cold-sensitive arrest in G1 noticed in CDC50 mutants [PMID:11180453] may be due to inactivation of CDC39.  The effects of LEM3 on glucocorticoid receptor activity may also be due to effects on transcription via CDC39.',\n",

In quiescent cells, ZPR1 is localised to the cytoplasm. But in proliferating cells treated with EGF or with other mitogens, ZPR1 accumulates in the nucleolus. ZPR1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the inactive EGF receptor (EGFR) and is thought to inhibit the basal protein tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. This interaction is disrupted when cells are treated with EGF, though by themselves, inactive EGFRs are not sufficient to sequester ZPR1 to the cytoplasm [PMID:9852145, PMID:9763455, PMID:8650580]. Upon stimulation by EGF, ZPR1 directly binds the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-1alpha (eEF-1alpha) to form ZPR1/eEF-1alpha complexes [PMID:9852145]. These move into the nucleus, localising particularly at the nucleolus. Indeed, the interaction between ZPR1 and eEF-1alpha has been shown to be essential for normal cellular proliferation [PMID:9852145], and ZPR1 is thought to be involved in pre-ribosomal RNA expression [PMID:9763455]. The ZPR1 domain consists of an elongation initiation factor 2-like zinc finger and a double-stranded beta helix with a helical hairpin insertion. ZPR1 binds preferentially to GDP-bound eEF1A but does not directly influence the kinetics of nucleotide exchange or GTP hydrolysis [PMID:17704259]. The alignment for this family shows a domain of which there are two copies in ZPR1 proteins. This family also includes several hypothetical archaeal proteins (from both Crenarchaeota and Euryarchaeota), which only contain one copy of the aligned region.

The chemotaxis machinery of Bacillus subtilis is similar to that of the well characterised system of Escherichia coli. However, B. subtilis contains several chemotaxis genes not found in the E. coli genome, such as CheC and CheD, indicating that the B. subtilis chemotactic system is more complex. CheD plays an important role in chemotactic sensory transduction for many organisms. CheD deamidates other B. subtilis chemoreceptors including McpB and McpC. Deamidation by CheD is required for B. subtilis chemoreceptors to effectively transduce signals to the CheA kinase [PMID:12011078]. The structure of a complex between the signal-terminating phosphatase, CheC, and the receptor-modifying deamidase, CheD, reveals how CheC mimics receptor substrates to inhibit CheD and how CheD stimulates CheC phosphatase activity. CheD resembles other cysteine deamidases from bacterial pathogens that inactivate host Rho-GTPases. Phospho-CheY, the intracellular signal and CheC target, stabilises the CheC-CheD complex and reduces availability of CheD [PMID:16469702].

These functions depend on the various FeS cluster prosthetic groups, the most common being [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] [PMID:16221578]. FeS cluster assembly is a complex process involving the mobilisation of Fe and S atoms from storage sources, their assembly into [Fe-S] form, their transport to specific cellular locations, and their transfer to recipient apoproteins. So far, three FeS assembly machineries have been identified, which are capable of synthesising all types of [Fe-S] clusters: ISC (iron-sulphur cluster), SUF (sulphur assimilation), and NIF (nitrogen fixation) systems. The SUF system is an alternative pathway to the ISC system that operates under iron starvation and oxidative stress. It is found in eubacteria, archaea and eukaryotes (plastids). The SUF system is encoded by the suf operon (sufABCDSE), and the six encoded proteins are arranged into two complexes (SufSE and SufBCD) and one protein (SufA). SufS is a pyridoxal-phosphate (PLP) protein displaying cysteine desulphurase activity. SufE acts as a scaffold protein that accepts S from SufS and donates it to SufA [PMID:17350000].

Most proteins with a copy of this repeat have domains associated with membrane autotransporters (Pfam:PF03797). The repeats occur with a periodicity of 60 to 100 residues. A pattern of sequence conservation is that every second residue is well-conserved across most of the domain.  These repeats as likely to have a beta-helical structure.

The repeat is always associated with the passenger domain of the autotransporter. For these reasons it has been coined the Passenger-associated Transport Repeat (PATR) [PMID:25869731]. The mechanism by which the PATR motif promotes transport is uncertain but it is likely that the conserved glycines (see HMM Logo) are required for flexibility of folding and that this folding drives secretion [PMID:25869731].

Bacillus and Clostridium are two well studied endospore forming bacteria. Spore formation provides a resistance mechanism in response to extreme or unfavourable environmental conditions such as heat, radiation, and chemical agents or nutrient deprivation.  The reverse process termed germination takes place where spores develop into growing cells in response to nutrient availability or stress reduction. Nutrient germinant receptors (GRs) and the SpoVA proteins are important players in the germination process. In B.subtilis the SpoVAC and SpoVAEB, belonging to this domain family, are predicted to be membrane proteins, with two to five membrane spanning. Biophysical and biochemical studies suggest that SpoVAC acts as a mechano-sensitive channel with properties that would allow the release of Ca-DPA (dipicolinic acid) and amino acids during germination of the spore. The release of Ca-DPA is a crucial event during spore germination. When expressed in E.coli SpoVAC provides protection against osmotic downshift. Furthermore, SpoVAC acts as channel that facilitates the efflux down the concentration gradient of osmolytes up to a mass of at least 600 Da [PMID:24666282].

The GPS motif is a conserved sequence of ~40 amino acids containing canonical cysteine and tryptophan residues, and is the most highly conserved part of the domain. In most, if not all, cell-adhesion GPCRs these undergo autoproteolysis in the GPS between a conserved aliphatic residue (usually a leucine) and a threonine, serine, or cysteine residue [PMID:12270923]. In higher eukaryotes this motif is found embedded in the C-terminal beta-stranded part of a GAIN domain - GPCR-Autoproteolysis INducing (GAIN). The GAIN-GPS domain adopts a fold in which the GPS motif, at the C-terminus, forms five beta-strands that are tightly integrated into the overall GAIN domain. The GPS motif, evolutionarily conserved from tetrahymena to mammals, is the only extracellular domain shared by all human cell-adhesion GPCRs and PKD proteins, and is the locus of multiple human disease mutations. The GAIN-GPS domain is both necessary and sufficient functionally for autoproteolysis, suggesting an autoproteolytic mechanism whereby the overall GAIN domain fine-tunes the chemical environment in the GPS to catalyse peptide bond hydrolysis [PMID:22333914]. In the cell-adhesion GPCRs and PKD proteins, the GPS motif is always located at the end of their long N-terminal extracellular regions, immediately before the first transmembrane helix of the respective protein.',\n",

Two major structural variants have been identified based on the structural context of the C-terminal Cys residue of disulfide 'c' in the C-terminal hairpin: hEGFs and cEGFs. In hEGFs the C-terminal thiol resides in the beta-turn, resulting in shorter loop-lengths between the Cys residues of disulfide 'c', typically C[8-9]XC.
